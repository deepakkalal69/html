        including Bulgaria, London, New York City, Edinburgh, Thailand, Manali, Mumbai and Varanasi.

        and monetary constraints, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film score is composed by 
        Simon Franglen, while the soundtrack is composed by Pritam and written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. 
        Produced on an estimated budget of ₹410 crore (US$51 million), it will be one of the most expensive
