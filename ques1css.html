        Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language fantasy action-adventure 
        film written and directed by Ayan Mukerji.It is produced by Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta, 
        Namit Malhotra, and Mukherji – in his debut production – under the production companies 
        Dharma Productions, Starlight Pictures, and Prime Focus in association with Star Studios, 
        along with Ranbir Kapoor and Marijke DeSouza. The film was first conceived by Mukerji in 
        2011, with core elements being inspired by Indian history and stories he heard in his childhood. 
        Its development was first revealed in July 2014 with a planned release for 2016, but its
        official announcement by Johar would only arrive in October 2017; initially named Dragon, 
        the announcement also revealed that the film would be titled Brahmāstra and have two sequels. 
        Principal photography lasted for five years from February 2018 to March 2022, with filming locations 
        including Bulgaria, London, New York City, Edinburgh, Thailand, Manali, Mumbai and Varanasi.
        Production and release of the film was delayed multiple times, first due to production delays 
        and monetary constraints, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film score is composed by 
        Simon Franglen, while the soundtrack is composed by Pritam and written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. 
        Produced on an estimated budget of ₹410 crore (US$51 million), it will be one of the most expensive 
        Indian films and the most expensive outright Hindi film at the time of its release.
        Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva will be theatrically released on 9 September 2022 in standard formats,
        3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX 3D by Star Studios in India, and by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Worldwide.

        The story of the film revolves around the ultimate weapon of the gods that is unrivaled in power.
        The source informs, “It’s an ancient weapon that has been broken and stored in the land of gods 
        at multiple places in India. The first part of the trilogy revolves around Shiva’s discovery of 
        fire within him and how that eventually leads him towards the weapon named Brahmastra.” Ranbir plays 
        Shiva who finds the fire within him to find this weapon, Alia plays Isha who aids him in his 
        adventurous journey, Amitabh Bachchan plays Shiva’s Guru and Nagarjuna plays an archaeologist who
        is restoring an ancient temple in Varanasi.
